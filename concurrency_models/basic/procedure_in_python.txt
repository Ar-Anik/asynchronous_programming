Q : What is Procedure?
-> A procedure is a named block of code that performs a specific task but does not return a value. The procedure can be
called by another part of the program.

-> A procedure in Python is a callable that is intended to perform actions (side effects) rather than compute and return
a meaningful value — in practice this is any function/method/callable whose purpose is its effect and which typically
returns None (implicitly or explicitly). In Python terminology the word function is primary; procedure is a conceptual
sub-class of function focused on actions.

# Terminology and relationship to “function”
Many programming languages distinguish function (returns a value) and procedure (does not return a value). Python does
not enforce a separate language construct for procedures — every procedure is implemented as a Python function, method
or callable object.

A practical convention : label something a procedure when its role is to perform I/O, mutate state, produce side effects
or drive control flow not to compute a reusable value. Such callables typically have return type None.


# Syntax and a minimal example
def log_message(message) -> None:
    """A simple procedure that writes a message to stdout."""
    print(message)          # side effect
    # no return statement -> returns None implicitly

Calling log_message("hello") prints to standard output. The function returns None so treating it as a value-computing
function is not the intent.


# Explicit None
def store(obj, container) -> None:
    container.append(obj)
    return None   # explicit but redundant

Type hinting a procedure: None is the canonical type hint indicating the callable does not return a meaningful value.
