Q : What is Subroutine?
-> A subroutine in Python is any callable block of code that performs a specific task and can be invoked from elsewhere in
the program — most commonly implemented as a function (defined with def or lambda) but also as a method, a callable
object (an instance implementing __call__), a builtin function or an async function/generator when those semantics are
required.

-> The term subroutine is language-agnostic: it historically means “a named sequence of instructions that can be executed
from different places” (also called procedure, routine or function in various languages). In Python practice, function is
the usual name; method is the term used when a function is an attribute of a class and bound to an instance or class.

# Key properties of subroutines in Python:
- Encapsulation of behavior: a subroutine groups statements to perform a single logical operation.
- Parameterization: inputs (arguments) can be passed in.
- Reusability: the same subroutine can be called from many places.
- Abstraction: callers need not know the implementation details.
- Return value(s): a subroutine may return a value (or None implicitly).


# Example
def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b

result = add(2, 3)  # result == 5

Here, def creates a function object and binds it to the name add.
